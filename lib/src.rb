# This file is a stand-in that allows for the generation of rdoc documentation
# for the FireRuby extension for the Ruby programming language. The extension
# is coded in C and documented with Doxygen comments, so this file is used to
# generate the native Ruby documentation instead.

# This module contains all of the classes and definitions relating to the
# FireRuby extension for the Ruby language.

      # SQL query then the method returns a ResultSet object. For non-query SQL
      # statements (insert, update or delete) the method returns an Integer that
      # contains the number of rows affected by the statement. For all other
      # statements the method returns nil. The method  also accepts a block that
      # takes a single parameter. If the SQL statement was a query the block
      # will be invoked and passed each row retrieved.
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      # sql::  A string containing the SQL statement to be executed.
      #
      # ==== Exceptions
      # Exception::  Generated whenever the Transaction object represents more
