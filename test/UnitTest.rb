# Old Unit Test Suite
#
# This code has been dropped for two reasons. First, adding new tests requires
# that this code be updated. Second, running the tests in a single Ruby
# interpreter seems to cause issues as the tests create, use and drop a lot of
# database files and this seems to cause intermittent problems with one or more
# of the test scripts that doesn't occur when the script is run on its own.
# Changing the number of scripts run also seemed to cause the problems to go
# away. It didn't seem to matter which scripts where left out which leads me
# to believe that the problem is related to timing issues.
#
# The new unit test suite, below, searches the directory for unit test files
# and executes each in their own interpreter. I have left this code here for
# reference purposes.
